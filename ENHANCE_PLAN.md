# Global Supply Chain Tycoon (GSCT) Enhancement Roadmap

This document outlines the proposed features and functional expansions to improve the "SCM Learning Value" and "Gameplay Experience" of GSCT.

---

## 1. Complexity: Multi-Product & BOM (Bill of Materials)
Evolve from simple single-product logistics to the reality of manufacturing, where finished goods are assembled from multiple parts.

- **BOM System:**
  - Example: Product A = Raw Material X(2) + Component Y(1).
  - Add complexity by requiring players to coordinate the arrival of multiple components at a factory (Kitting/Synchronization).
- **Lead Time Stacking:**
  - Since different parts have different procurement lead times, simulate the critical SCM challenge where "a single missing screw stops the entire assembly line."
- **Learning Objectives:** Synchronization, Shortage Risk Management, Component Inventory Optimization.

## 2. Expansion: Supply Chain Network Investment
Enable players to expand their global footprint through strategic capital expenditure, moving beyond managing a pre-set map.

- **Node Development Investment:**
  - **Raw Material Sites:** Improve extraction efficiency and secure rare materials.
  - **Factories:** Add production lines, implement automation (reduce processing costs), and improve quality control.
  - **Markets:** Stimulate demand through advertising and develop local distribution networks.
- **New Hub Discovery:**
  - Spend cash to build new nodes (facilities) in new countries, requiring players to redesign their optimal logistics network.
- **Learning Objectives:** ROI (Return on Investment) analysis, Vertical Integration vs. Horizontal Specialization, Global Network Design.

## 3. Sustainability: CO2 Emissions & Green Investment
Incorporate "Green Transformation (GX)," a top-priority theme in modern SCM, into the core gameplay.

- **Carbon Footprint Visualization:**
  - Calculate CO2 emissions based on transport modes (Air = High, Sea = Low) and factory operations.
- **Carbon Tax & Environmental Regulations:**
  - Implement taxes based on emission levels or penalties for exceeding certain thresholds.
- **Green Investment:**
  - Upgrade to "Electric Cargo Ships" or "Renewable Energy Factories" to reduce long-term tax burdens and improve brand value.
- **Learning Objectives:** Trade-offs between environmental impact and cost, ESG management, Sustainable Supply Chain.

## 4. Risk Management: Supply Chain Disruptions
Test resilience against uncertainty (VUCA) through dynamic in-game events.

- **Random Events:**
  - "Canal blockages," "Port strikes," or "Extreme weather conditions" in specific regions.
- **Emergency Response Mode:**
  - Allow players to set up "Emergency Air Freights" or "Alternative Routes" during crises to minimize stockouts.
- **Learning Objectives:** Resilience, BCP (Business Continuity Planning), Strategic Safety Stock placement.

## 5. Strategic Missions: Emergency Orders & Contracts
Provide short-term business opportunities in addition to steady-state sales.

- **Spot Contracts:**
  - Time-limited missions such as "Deliver 100 units with 90%+ freshness to Germany within 10 days."
  - High rewards for success; heavy penalties for failure.
- **Learning Objectives:** Agility, Prioritization under pressure.

## 6. Advanced Analytics: Financial & Operational Visibility
Enhance BI (Business Intelligence) features to support data-driven decision-making.

- **Cost-to-Serve Analysis:**
  - Breakdown of "Manufacturing Cost," "Transport Cost," "Inventory Holding Cost," and "Wastage Loss" per unit.
- **Sensitivity Analysis Graphs:**
  - Simulate how total costs change when adjusting parameters like shipping frequency.
- **Learning Objectives:** Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), Data-Driven Management.

## 7. Game Flow: Customizable Duration & Intermediate Results
Enhance the game progression by allowing players to set the duration and review their performance periodically.

- **Game Duration Setting:**
  - Select the game duration (e.g., 1 year, 3 years, 5 years) on the start screen.
- **Year-by-Year Progression:**
  - The game pauses at the end of each year to display intermediate performance reports (financials, KPIs).
- **In-Game Year Display:**
  - Real-time display of the current progress (e.g., "Year 2 of 5") on the main game screen.
- **Learning Objectives:** Long-term strategic planning, performance review cycles, and target management.

## Proposed Implementation Phases

1.  **Phase 1 (Basic Logic):** Game Duration Settings, Risk Management Events & Emergency Orders (Implementable with existing systems).
2.  **Phase 2 (Visibility):** Advanced Analytics & Financial Visualization (TCO awareness).
3.  **Phase 3 (Growth):** Network Expansion through Development Investment.
4.  **Phase 4 (Complex Logic):** Introduction of Multi-Product & BOM.
5.  **Phase 5 (Sustainability):** CO2 Emissions & Green Investment.
